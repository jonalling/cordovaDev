# cordovaDev
An Ionic development app based on the tabs starter that interfaces with several ngCordova plugins.  

- [Device Motion](http://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/deviceMotion/)

- [Device Orientation](http://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/deviceOrientation/)
- [Geolocation](http://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/geolocation/)
- [BLE (undocumented)](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/src/plugins/ble.js) //still in development

This repo is not a complete app, you first need to start a new ionic app with the tabs starter.
