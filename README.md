# cordovaDev
An Ionic development app based on the tabs starter that interfaces with several ngCordova plugins. This repo is not a complete app, you first need to start a new ionic app with the tabs starter.

### [Device Orientation](http://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/deviceOrientation/)
### [Geolocation](http://ngcordova.com/docs/plugins/geolocation/)
### [BLE (undocumented)](https://github.com/driftyco/ng-cordova/blob/master/src/plugins/ble.js)

BLE function still in development.  Scan, Connect, Read methods work. StartNotification does not yet because of ngCordova issue, ngCordova and Plugin author are working on a fix. Beware of current poor user experience.
